# Zombifier

Simple & configurable plugin to spawn zombies on player death for Bukkit on Minecraft 1.12!

Main command is "/zombifier", and main permission nodes are "zombifier.*" !

Use the options in config to edit the way the plugin works on your server. Change "enabled" to false to disable the plugin, or use the in-game command "/zombifier enable off". You can turn it back on with "/zombifier enable on".

config:

    LOADED MARKER | Dummy value to check against at start-up, don't change!
    ENABLED | If true, players will spawn a zombie on their corpses at death.
    TYPE | Determines the mob spawned. Supported types: zombie. Coming soon: baby, skeleton, pigman, blaze, wither.
    LANGUAGE | Currently supported languages: English only (for now!)
    SILENT MODE | If true, most messages will not be relayed to players.
    PERMISSIONS REQUIREMENT | If true, players must have the proper permissions to use basic Zombifier commands.
